## The Front-End side of the Fullstack Todo-List App
##### This is just the client side, I will soon be adding in the backend/server side on GitHub to show the RESTful API and the database.
##### The technologies used for the Fullstack App consists of PostgreSQL, Express.js, React and Node.js 
##### My plans are to either deploy the front end on Netlify and the backend on Heroku or just have the entire application on Heroku
